# Virtual Memory Management Visualization Tool

This tool provides an interactive visualization of virtual memory management concepts including paging, segmentation, and page replacement algorithms.

## Features
- Visualize page tables and memory allocation
- Simulate page faults and demand paging
- Experiment with different page replacement algorithms (LRU, Optimal)
- Memory fragmentation visualization
- Interactive memory allocation simulation

## Setup
1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage
- Use the sidebar to configure memory parameters
- Experiment with different page replacement algorithms
- Visualize memory allocation and fragmentation in real-time
- Analyze page fault statistics
